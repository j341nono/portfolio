## Introduction: Crafting My Digital Space

Hello everyone! I'm Nonomura Kanade.

I'm excited to launch my new portfolio. On this site, I will be sharing my research findings and projects.

This photo was taken at a shopping mall in Santa Monica during a trip to Los Angeles. I'd love to visit LA again!
